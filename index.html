            <p class="abstract-text">
                Pediatric dental anxiety is a multifactorial clinical challenge influenced by emotional regulation,
                communication, and prior experiences.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                Current approaches largely rely on static anxiety assessment methods conducted before or after
                treatment, offering limited support during the clinical procedure itself.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                This gap restricts real-time awareness, negatively affects patient cooperation, and disrupts clinical
                workflow continuity.

            <p class="abstract-text">
                This project introduces a human-centered, AI-assisted framework designed to support — not replace —
                clinical decision-making.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                Artificial intelligence is positioned as an adaptive and ethical support layer rather than a diagnostic
                authority.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                Clinical responsibility and authority remain exclusively with the dentist, ensuring professional
                autonomy while enhancing situational awareness and patient communication.

            <p class="abstract-text">
                The proposed framework aims to reduce pediatric dental anxiety and improve patient cooperation during
                clinical procedures.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-text">
                Expected outcomes include enhanced clinician preparedness, smoother workflow continuity, reduced
                uncertainty, and lower perceived cognitive load.

            <p class="abstract-text">
                Overall, the system offers a scalable, clinically feasible, and ethically safe approach compatible with
                routine pediatric dental practice.

                        <p>I am participating in this competition from Türkiye as a second-year English-department
                            dental student at Ankara University Faculty of Dentistry. I am a participant in the poster
                            competition organized by the Haiden Organization, in San Diego. For this competition, I
                            developed an original project idea and followed a solution-oriented approach based on
                            relevant academic research.</p>
                        <div class="author-bio-extended">
                            <p>This project emerged from the need to address pediatric dental care not only as a
                                clinical procedure but also as an emotional and cognitive experience. During my dental
                                education, I observed that anxiety in pediatric patients significantly affects both the
                                treatment process and dentist–patient communication. Therefore, I focused on developing
                                a concept aimed at managing dental anxiety in children.</p>
                            <p>The aim of this study is to contribute to the reduction of children's dental anxiety and
                                to support clinicians' situational awareness through a human-centered, ethical, and
                                clinically compatible AI-supported approach using a digital avatar. The project
                                positions technology not as a decision-maker, but as an assistive tool that supports the
                                clinical workflow.</p>
